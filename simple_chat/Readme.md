# Simple Chat

This LLM application creates a chat bot using the Ollama OpenApi compatible REST endpoint. 
It highlights the use of chat history so that the LLM can 'remember' your previous questions during a chat session.

Additionally, the example will print out the number of 'tokens' currently in the chat history to show how the size of
the context window limits the LLM's short-term 'memory'.
