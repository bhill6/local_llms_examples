# Llama-Index

## Overview

LlamaIndex is a python library that enables the rapid creation of Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines. This example
ingests the story Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, and can then answer questions about it.

The emphasis in this project is to contrast how little code is required to do this versus the [rag-embed](../rag-embed) example.
